## Project Overview
This competition centers on the question of how to make T cells, the fighter cells of our immune system, better at killing cancer cells. 

While scientists have tested some genetic modifications, or “perturbations,” to T cells in the lab, there are too many possible perturbations — and combinations of perturbations — to solve this problem experimentally. The goal is to bring machine learning to this problem to help identify which perturbations could make cancer immunotherapy more effective.

## Project Objective
- Predict the effect of unseen, held-out genetic modifications, or "perturbations," to T cells.
- Propose the best individual gene modifications to make T cells more effective for cancer immunotherapy.
- Propose a “scoring function,” or metric, for ranking the effectiveness of a perturbation.
